# üìù ViewFi

## üåü Project Overview

The world's first web3 video ads solution that reward users for engagement.

ViewFi reimagines video marketing for brands by turning the video player into a lead generation that harnesses web3 technology and AI to empower marketers with tools to capture attention and collect data while offering viewers rewards from brands for their engagement. 
The platform will utilize Polkadot's parachain capabilities to ensure efficient token dispensing and NFT reward mechanisms. 

### üîç Project Details

**Tech Stack**

Java, Spring, Postgres, React, Solidity, Forge, PReact and TypeScript. We use Infura for indexing and integrated into Wallet Connect SDK plus MetaKeep for wallet generation.

**Core Documentation**

- Video player widget with integrated reward mechanisms
- Smart contracts for token dispensing and NFT rewards
- Wallet infrastructure for seamless user onboarding
- Analytics dashboard for campaign performance tracking
- API for brand integration and campaign management

Comprehensive documentation available at: https://docs.viewfi.io/

**Product Deck:** https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1i1DazxM9ASsGpHKg39sfJdSsDU3C7dXL

**Project Limitation**
- Will not provide traditional advertising network services
- Will not store sensitive user data beyond necessary campaign metrics
- Will not integrate onchain solutions beyond NFT creation (and distriution) and token airdrop.

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

ViewDrop fits into Polkadot's ecosystem as a DeFi application that bridges traditional marketing with web3 rewards, driving mainstream user adoption through familiar video content experiences enhanced with blockchain-based incentives.

**Target Audience**

Primary: Brands and marketers seeking innovative, ROI-driven advertising solutions
Secondary: Web3 protocols wanting to grow their user base through rewarded video campaigns
Tertiary: End users who want to be rewarded for their attention and engagement

ViewFi addresses the critical need for privacy-compliant, engaging marketing solutions in the post-cookie era while simultaneously onboarding mainstream users to web3 through value exchange mechanisms.

**Competitors**

No direct competitors currently offer the same solution on any blockchain. Our unique approach combines video marketing, web3 rewards, and enterprise-grade partnerships, positioning us as the first-mover in this emerging category.
