# 📝 ViewFi

## 🌟 Project Overview

# Project Limitation
- Will not provide traditional advertising network services
- Will not store sensitive user data beyond necessary campaign metrics
- Will not integrate onchain solutions beyond NFT creation (and distriution) and token airdrop.

### 🧩 Ecosystem Fit

ViewDrop fits into Polkadot's ecosystem as a DeFi application that bridges traditional marketing with web3 rewards, driving mainstream user adoption through familiar video content experiences enhanced with blockchain-based incentives.

**Target Audience**
Primary: Brands and marketers seeking innovative, ROI-driven advertising solutions
Secondary: Web3 protocols wanting to grow their user base through rewarded video campaigns
Tertiary: End users who want to be rewarded for their attention and engagement

ViewFi addresses the critical need for privacy-compliant, engaging marketing solutions in the post-cookie era while simultaneously onboarding mainstream users to web3 through value exchange mechanisms.

**Competitors**
No direct competitors currently offer the same solution on any blockchain. Our unique approach combines video marketing, web3 rewards, and enterprise-grade partnerships, positioning us as the first-mover in this emerging category.
